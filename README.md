Python version 3.8.x

The follwoing Python packages are required:
- music21 8.3.x
- pandas 2.0.x
- matplotlib 3.7.x
- Keras 2.13.x
- tensorflow 2.13.x
- [madmom](https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom) 0.27.dev0

Other requirements
- [MuseScore4](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/4/download-and-installation), and add it in the PATH
- C++
- ffmpeg, can be installed by running:
    ```
    $ cd onset-model/tmp && wget https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-4.1.tar.bz2 \
        && tar xvjf ffmpeg-4.1.tar.bz2 && cd ffmpeg-4.1 \
        && ./configure && make
    $ export PATH=/tmp/ffmpeg-4.1:$PATH
    ```

# The Data Pipeline
Make sure you run all scripts from inside the directory.

Run the data pipeline with

```
$ cd data-pipeline
$ python main.py
```

The data pipeline will take MusicXML files located in `/data-pipeline/corpus/mxl` and output a dataset in the `/dataset` directory

Once the transformation is complete, the script will start MuseScore4 processes which will convert the transformed MusicXML files to audio. You can check if the processes are complete on the Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac).

Upon completion, you will find the generated dataset inside data-pipeline/dataset :
- The `/audio` folder will contain the generated audio files
- The `/mxl` folder will contain the generated MusicXML files
- The `/annotations` folder will contain records of onsets and accents for each audio file
- The `/labels` folder contains labels for visualising onsets and accents inside Audacity
  

# The Onset Model

Original model by Bj√∂orn Lindqvist
(https://github.com/bjourne/onset-replication)

## Configuration

Paths to input, output and cache data has to be configured by
modifying the `CONFIGS` constant in the `onset-model/config.py` file. The right
config is selected during runtime by matching on the system and
hostname. This way the same `onset-model/config.py` can be used on multiple
systems without requiring any changes.

The `data-dir` field should be set to the directory containing the
dataset, `cache-dir` to a directory storing cache files in pickle
format and `model-dir` to the directory in which built models should
be stored.

The `seed` field contains the seed to the random number generators
ensuring that *exactly* the same results a produced every
time. `digest` contains the checksum of the cache file. It is
important that the cache file does not change during training or
evaluation.

## Training

Training is done using the `main.py` script:
```
$ cd onset-model
$ python main.py -t 0:8 -n cnn --epochs 20
```
There are 3 options for the -n flag: multiclass, multilabel1, multilabel2.
Training can be stopped and resumed at any time.

## Evaluation

Evaluation is done using the `main.py` script:
```
$ python main.py -e 0:8 -n cnn
```

There are 3 options for the -n flag: multilabel1, multilabel2.
The evalutation function will record results of every function trained and output the records in a csv file inside ./results.
